THOUGHT: I need to analyze your Git commit history to generate a comprehensive report with specific sections: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, COMMIT PATTERN ANALYSIS, WORK PATTERNS & DEVELOPMENT VELOCITY, TECHNICAL INSIGHTS, and CODE EVOLUTION TIMELINE, plus PRODUCTIVITY METRICS. I'll start by parsing the commit data to extract timestamps, authors, messages, and other metadata. I'll then identify patterns in commit frequency, author activity, and technical themes, categorizing changes into features, fixes, and refactors. I'll map the evolution of the codebase over time, track productivity metrics like lines of code changed, and structure the report with clear sections and bullet points. I'll include a statistics table at the top as requested, followed by the structured analysis, and ensure all data is accurately represented before delivering the final report.
